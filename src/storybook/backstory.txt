[1] You are outside the convenience store, about to walk home from a long day of work.
[1] The moon is out, but the skies are still void of light.
[1.2] Visibility is low, that’s a given, but oddly you feel a sense of foreboding.
[1] You look to your right and your left.
[1.5] “All clear”, you whisper to yourself. The coast is clear, so you begin walking.
[1] Step by step, foot by foot, you creep across the street.
[1] However out of the corner of your eyes, you see the dreaded white light.
[1] A truck comes barreling towards you.
[1] You try to jump out of the way but your actions are in vain.
[1.2] The truck plows through you, leaving your body mangled on the cold, hard concrete.
[1] You can't see anything, pure nothingness.

[.5] …

[1] You awake, in an unfamiliar place.
[1] You look around. It looks nothing like the world you are used to.
[1.5] Confused, you stand up and walk around. Your body feels lighter; unlike how you used to be.
[1] It’s an unexpected change but a welcome one.
[1] You walk for what feels like forever before coming across a head. Yes, a head.
[1] One not attached to a body.
[1] You shriek at the top of your lungs before stumbling back.
[1.25] You look around frantically and surely enough, you find the owner of the head.
[1] The body of a man seemingly in his late 20s.

[1] Before you can regather your composure you hear rustling in the bushes.
[1] “Who’s there?”, you call out.
[1] A slight pause, before you then hear a maniacal laugh from the figure.
[1.5] “Me? You don’t need to know about me. Though, you should be more concerned about yourself”.
[1] You look down, and surely enough there is a gaping hole through your chest.
[1] You start to panic. Fear envelops your mind, blurring your vision.
[1] The figure moves out of the bushes and inches closer till they are right in front of you.
[1] They kneel to match your eye level and they but one phrase: “You’re in my domain now”.
[1.5] You don’t even have time to contemplate this before darkness embraces you once more.

[.5] ...
[.5] ...
[.5] ...

[1] You awake once more, lost and confused.
[1.3] Everything’s blurry. You try to refocus your eyes, but to no avail.
[1] “Hello, young one”, a female voice says to you.
[1.7] “Poor thing, you must be so confused; but do not fret, for everything will be going your way soon enough”.
[1] What does she mean? You feel your eyes getting heavier.
[1] Slowy, slowly they shut until once more, all you can see is darkness.

[.5] ...
[.5] ...
[.5] ...

[1] You wake up once more, breathing heavily.
[1] Your lungs feel like they’re filled with concrete and you struggle to get up.
[1] Once you are up you feel a jolt through your body.
[1] You feel like you’ve been here before.
[1] Your thoughts become clearer and you seem to recall what you are sure that you’ve never experienced before.
[1] You feel confident; confident that you know what you’re doing.

[1] First things first, let’s find a city.
